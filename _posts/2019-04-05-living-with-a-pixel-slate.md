title: Living with A Pixel Slate
---
I've owned many tablets. My first tablet ran Windows 7 and was absymal. I recall my first Android tablet running Honeycomb, which didn't really spark joy, as they say. The first tablet I ever liked was a Surface Pro 4, but I spilled some water on it and killed it. My last tablet, a Samsung TabPro running Windows 10 was my running favorite; it was the best of the Surface, but with USB-C and a thinner, lighter build. It was great at everything, except Windows kinda sucks at power management still, and Chrome was a slow resource hog. 

Enter Pixel Slate, where Chrome is a first class citizen finally and if I live within it I can generally expect 10-15 hours of battery life, estimates I could only dream of on any Windows device, let alone a Surface.
